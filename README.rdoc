== README

This is a simple app designed to allow for the conversion of decimal numbers,
that are representative of irrational numbers to approximations of rational
numbers.

As an example the ideal behavior would be to convert something like 
0.39269908169 => pi/8

The current app is available for usage at http://irrational-mind.herokuapp.com

Using Rails 4.0.2 and Ruby 2.0.0
